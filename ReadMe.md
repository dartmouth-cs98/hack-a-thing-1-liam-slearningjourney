# Hack-A-Thing 1: iOS Dev. Readme
## Liam Jolley, January 2020
### Thing Description:
I went through a Swift Tutorial via LinkedIn Learning and made various modules about a fantasy video game to develop my skills.


### Who Did What:
I did everything


### What I Learned:
Through the fantasy video game storyline, I learned about Swift's language concepts new to me like optionals, enumerations, error handling as well as the core syntactical differences in Swift.

### What Didn't Work:
Many of the final challenges at the chapter ends did not work until I checked my incorrect code with the solutions given in the video.
