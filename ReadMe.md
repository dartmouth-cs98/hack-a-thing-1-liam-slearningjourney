# Hack-A-Thing 1: Swift and iOS Dev. Readme
## Liam Jolley, January 2020

### What I Learned:
Through the fantasy video game storyline, I learned about Swift's language concepts that were new to me like optionals, enumerations, error handling as well as the core syntactical differences in Swift from other languages. Through the iOS development tutorials, I learned the basics of coding an iOS app through XCode, such as maneuvering in the IDE, making the app compatibile with different devices, and implementing simple button functionality.
