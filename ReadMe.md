# Hack-A-Thing 1: Swift and iOS Dev. Readme
## Liam Jolley, January 2020
### Thing Description:
I went through two Swift tutorials via LinkedIn Learning. For the first, I coded various modules about a fantasy video game to develop my simple Swift programming skills. For the second, I created a "Hello World" iOS15 App and created a simple "pasteboard" app, which logs what information you copy into your clipboard.


### Who Did What:
I did not work with a partner.


### What I Learned:
Through the fantasy video game storyline, I learned about Swift's language concepts that were new to me like optionals, enumerations, error handling as well as the core syntactical differences in Swift from other languages. Through the iOS development tutorials, I learned the basics of coding an iOS app through XCode, such as maneuvering in the IDE, making the app compatibile with different devices, and implementing simple button functionality.

### What Didn't Work:
During the Swift tutorial, many of the chapter challenges did not work until I checked my incorrect code with the solutions given in the video. I managed to correclty implement the simple iOS tutorials.
